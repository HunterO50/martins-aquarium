                    <li>Get to know your destination in depth before you arrive. Read traveler reviews and consult with locals for information about the safest neighborhoods, places to stay and incidences of crime.</li>
                    <li>People who look like they’re from out of town are especially vulnerable to crime, so try to blend in as much as you can.</li>
                    <li>You never know when you might need a copy of your passport, driver’s license or another form of identification. Scan these documents to save online and print out several hard copies.</li>

            <li>Inspect the tank</li>
            <p1>A tank’s water, fish, plants, and accessories should be checked daily for signs of disease, wear, color changes, or changes in behavior.</p1>
            <li>Check water temperature.</li>
            <p1>Water temperature must remain consistent to prevent illness in fish, especially in saltwater aquariums. </p1>
            <li>Top off the tank’s water.</li>
            <p1>Water evaporates from a tank on a regular basis, meaning this vaporized water must be replaced</p1>
